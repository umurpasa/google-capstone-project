# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

I completed Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and as a final project I chose to analyze bike-share company named 
Cyclistic.

For this project, I used R for preparation, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing the data.

## Background

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations.The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
the company believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the company believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members.

The goal is designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, there is a need to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

## Goal of the project

Analyzing the data to see how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Steps and Deliverables

### A clear statement of the business task - ASK Phase

The primary objective of this analysis is to examine and compare the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic bikes. By identifying the key differences in their riding behaviors, preferences, and usage trends, we aim to provide actionable insights that the marketing team can leverage to design effective strategies for converting casual riders into annual members, ultimately enhancing customer retention and driving revenue growth for Cyclistic.

### A description of all data sources used - PREPARE Phase

There is 12 .csv files that includes Cyclistic's previous year data. Here is the image of the R script that shows how i upload them:
